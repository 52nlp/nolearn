nolearn contains a number of wrappers around existing neural network
libraries, along with a few machine learning utility modules.  Most
functionality is written to be compatible with the the excellent
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ library.

View the `documentation here <http://packages.python.org/nolearn/>`_.

When installing nolearn, it is recommended to use the requirements.txt
file included in the source.  To install the requirements for the most
recent version of nolearn from Git, you would run::

  pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnouri/nolearn/master/requirements.txt

nolearn includes a popular wrapper around the `Lasagne neural networks
library <https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne>`_.  An extensive
`tutorial showing how to use Lasagne through nolearn to detect facial
keypoints is available here
<http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/>`_.
The `code for the tutorial is also available
<https://github.com/dnouri/kfkd-tutorial>`_.
