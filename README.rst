nolearn contains a number of wrappers around existing neural network
libraries, along with a few machine learning utility modules.  Most
functionality is written to be compatible with the the excellent
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ library.

View the `documentation here <http://packages.python.org/nolearn/>`_.

nolearn includes a popular wrapper around the Lasagne neural networks
library.  An extensive `tutorial showing how to use Lasagne through
nolearn to detect facial keypoints is available here
<http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/>`_.
The `code for the tutorial is also available
<https://github.com/dnouri/kfkd-tutorial>`_.
